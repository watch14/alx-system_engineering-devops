Server:
A server is a computer or system that provides services, resources, or functionality to other computers, known as clients, in a network. In the context of web hosting, a server may host files, applications, or databases that are accessed by users over the internet.

Role of the Domain Name:
A domain name serves as a human-readable alias for the IP address of a server. It allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names (e.g., www.foobar.com) instead of numeric IP addresses.

DNS Record for www.foobar.com:
The DNS record type for www in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. This record points the www subdomain to the domain's primary record, helping streamline domain management.

Role of the Web Server:
The web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and serving static content like HTML, CSS, and images. It may also handle tasks such as SSL termination, load balancing, and managing incoming web traffic.

Role of the Application Server:
The application server executes server-side logic, processes dynamic content, and interacts with databases. It runs applications and performs tasks like running scripts, managing user sessions, and handling business logic.

Role of the Database:
The database stores and manages data used by the web application. It is where information such as user profiles, content, and other structured data are stored and retrieved. MySQL, mentioned earlier, is an example of a database management system.

Server Communication with User's Computer:
The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or its secure variant, HTTPS. This communication protocol facilitates the exchange of information between the web server and the user's browser, enabling the retrieval and display of web pages.

SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
The architecture lacks redundancy, risking complete system failure if a critical component goes down.

Downtime and Scalability Challenges:
Deploying new code or performing maintenance causes downtime, and scaling to handle increased traffic is limited in the current setup.
