Additional Elements:
Additional elements, like load balancers and database clusters, are added to enhance system reliability, performance, and scalability. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic, and database clusters provide redundancy and fault tolerance.

Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm:
The load balancer is configured with a Round Robin distribution algorithm. It evenly distributes incoming requests among multiple servers, ensuring a balanced load and preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:
The load balancer enables an Active-Active setup. In this configuration, all servers are actively handling traffic simultaneously, providing increased performance and redundancy. In contrast, an Active-Passive setup designates one server as active, handling traffic, while the passive server remains on standby, only becoming active if the primary server fails.

Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster:
In a Primary-Replica database cluster, the Primary node (Master) handles write operations and updates the data. Replica nodes (Slaves) replicate the data from the Primary node and handle read operations. This setup provides data redundancy, fault tolerance, and scalability.

Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:
The Primary node is responsible for write operations, making updates to the database. Replica nodes mirror the data from the Primary and handle read operations. This distribution allows for improved read performance and redundancy, enhancing the overall system's reliability.

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The infrastructure lacks redundancy, risking complete system failure if a critical component goes down.

Security and Monitoring Gaps:
Absence of a firewall and HTTPS poses security risks, while the lack of monitoring tools hinders proactive issue detection and resolution.
