Load Balancer:
Why: Distributes traffic among multiple servers, enhancing reliability and performance.

Firewall:
Why: Provides security by filtering and controlling network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and attacks.

HTTPS (SSL/TLS):
Why: Encrypts data for secure communication, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

Monitoring Tools:
Why: Offers proactive oversight, detecting performance issues and contributing to system reliability.

Data Collection for Monitoring:
How: Collects data from metrics, logs, and performance indicators through agents, APIs, or other sources.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:
How: Use monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to track and analyze queries per second, aiding in resource optimization and performance management.

Terminating SSL at Load Balancer:
Issue: Security risk due to unencrypted communication internally.

Single MySQL Server for Writes:
Issue: Single Point of Failure, limiting scalability and risking downtime.

Uniform Servers with Same Components:
Issue: Challenges in scalability and fault isolation due to lack of component diversity.
