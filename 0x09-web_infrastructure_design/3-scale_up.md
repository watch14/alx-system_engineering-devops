Additional Server:
Why: Enables separation of components (web server, application server, database) for independent scaling, maintenance, and enhanced security.

Load Balancer (HAproxy):
Why: Distributes traffic evenly among servers for optimal resource utilization and introduces redundancy for high availability, minimizing the risk of a single point of failure.

Split Components:
Why: Allows for targeted scaling, maintenance, and fault isolation. Enhances security by compartmentalizing functions, simplifying troubleshooting, and minimizing the impact of vulnerabilities.
